README up to date with Agile Sprint Retrospective from SNHU Prompt

This dislpays comprehensive understanding of Aglie/Scrum team framework of project management.

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

 End User needs are met by developing software with constant customer collaboration through comprehensive end user QA testing throughout the full developmetn process.. The initial user stories are created with cutomer input gathered by a product manager or similar appointed team mate. 
 
How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I develop programs based on user specificaton and necessity. Methods I hope to utilize in the future careers are scrum teams, and pair programming. Scrum teams I think ae very effective at tackling a total program development in incremental steps. Pair programming would be very beneficial for me to help me hone my code writing skillset.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

The most important attribute to being successful is accepting failure and using it to create better future versions. No great program was written in a day, and without failure true program maintainability is a much more arduous process. Failiure is not a goal, but an accepted obstacle on the path to success.
